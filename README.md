Sealog is in ongoing development thanks to the generosity of the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) who have supported the project since 2018. Thanks to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who provided the initial inspiration for the project and are it's first user. Thanks also to the University of Rhode Island.

Lastly I want to thank the UNOLS community who have helped me since the beginning by sharing their wealth of experience and technical ability.
